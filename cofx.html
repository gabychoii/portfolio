            <h3 class="research-description" id="text-semibold">
                The <b>coffee bar at Coffee Exchange</b> is intended to add an element 
                of personalization to the everyday coffee experience - this solves
                the issue of customer dissatisfaction that stems from differences 
                in individual preferences. The coffee bar allows a customer to 
                essentially <b>customize their own drink</b> through a <b>variety of mix-ins</b>,
                <b>reducing the time</b> a barista may need to typically spend 
                 <b>personalizing</b> various menu drinks. This coffee bar therefore allows 
                Coffee Exchange to have a <b>simpler menu,</b> notably saving
                time during busy hours.

                the add-ins such as the <b>milk jars and sugars</b>, which allows 
                a user to tailor the ratio of the ingredients in their 
                coffee to <b>their preference</b>, in addition to the milk and sugar

            <b>Community Cathy</b> loves the coffee bar interface because she

            overwhelmed by the growing selection of milk and sugar 
            substitutes that occupy the counter. However, she now 
            typically looks past them and ignores them.

            <b>Motivated Molly</b> enjoys the concept of interacting with the
            coffee bar interface, but finds the interface to
            be inconvenient when it is being used by multiple people,
            or when the surrounding area is crowded during
            a rush. With the intent of coming to Coffee Exchange to get
            work done, she gets slightly annoyed when
            she has to wait to maneuver around other users, and does 
            not enjoy the thought of having to speak to other
            customers. Additionally, she feels bad when interacting 
            with the current layout of the interface results in a
            spill or mess, and feels the need to act extra carefully 
            when customizing her coffee.

                The two personas are very different, primarily in motivation
                and goals, but additionally in actions. Regarding motivation,
                the personas represent users with different goals for being i
                n Coffee Exchange and interacting with the coffee bar interface 
                - one persona (“Community Cathy”) represents users who go to
                Coffee Exchange for the community, and whose habitual 
                interactions with the coffee bar elements represent routine. 
                On the other hand, the other persona (“Motivated Molly”), 
                represents users who are overwhelmed, yet productive college 
                students - although these users interact with the interface 
                on a more detailed level (use the substitute milks and sugars),
                they also have larger pain points with the interface.

                <b>Takeaways + Experience</b>
            </h2>
            <h3 class="note break-above">
                Overall, expecially as my first project in CSCI 1300 at Brown,
                this was the first time I had thought to narrow focus on and 
                analyze a single interface that I personally interact with 
                without second thought frequently (I have a very bad Coffee 
                Exchange obsession). It was so eye-opening to see how a set
                of design choices in a user interface caters to different
                sets of individuals differently. It was ultimately very 
                interesting to start to consider how I, as a prospective
                product manager or designer, would go about determining a
                target persona and designing this interface.
