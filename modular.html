                Modular is a growing tech startup startup creating a platform 
                for <b>developing and optimizing AI systems</b> - Modular's tech stack

                inference model to multiple hardware.

            <h3 class="problem-description" id="text-semibold">
                Modular's main problem was determining how to "improve" the
                Modular onboarding process. Modular was <b>losing 50% of potential
                users</b> simply due to the complexity of the onboarding stage. 
                Modular hypothesized this dropoff was due to the fact that the
                <b>onboarding process is complicated and long</b>, involving the use 
                of a terminal to run commands. Similarily, the old onboarding
                process brought the user to a <b>documentation page</b> that 
                convoluted and elongated the onboarding process on the user's end.

            <h3 class="research-description" id="text-semibold">
                Initially, we made two user-flows. <b>Flow One </b>was focused 
                on having the user create an account and then install the 
                application locally. <b>Flow Two</b> has the user install 
                the application locally first, test it, and then create 
                an account afterwards.  
            </h3>
            <h3 class="research-description" id="text-semibold">
                <b>Benefit:</b> Former would be users that have experienced 
                the Modular application before while the latter would be

            <h3 class="research-description" id="text-semibold">
                Our main design that we reflected in our Lo-Fi Wireframe
                was actually to <b>combine Flow One and Flow Two</b> to create
                a Forked User Flow. Instead of choosing which user-flow that
                would appeal to all users, we made the design choice to give
                that <b>choice to the user</b>. Then at the end, all users will 
                <b>end at the same position</b>, the user's <b>personal 
                dashboard</b>.
                
            </h3>
            <h3 class="research-description" id="text-semibold">
                <b>Benefit:</b> Appeals to users that are both familiar and 
                unfamiliar with the platform. so that they can get the most

                <b>Benefit:</b> Ensures that the user has followed the

                also solves the previous user pain point of being
