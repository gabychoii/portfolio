            <h3 class="problem-description" id="text-semibold">
                On first glance, the Zara website is admittedly “aesthetically 
                pleasing”, in the sense that it seemingly resembles an 
                editorial fashion magazine. However, in the digital website 
                format, this design choice results in an <b>poorly organized 
                    website and un-intuitive customer experience</b>. As visible in 
                the above screenshots, this begins with the home page, which 
                does a poor job of emphasizing the site elements users should 
                be interacting with - the table below describes several 
                issues pertaining to the usability of Zara’s website:

            <h3 class="research-description" id="text-semibold">
                The factor that most contributes to user frustration with the
                Zara website is its <b>un-intuitive design</b>. Ultimately, the Zara
                website lacks similarities to the traditional conceptual model
                of an online shopping website. This is likely due to the fact
                that the Zara website <b>attempts to mirror</b> the structure of an
                <b>editorial magazine</b>, which does does not translate well in digital form.
                As noted in the table above, the layout, coloring, and grouping of
                various components in the website <b>stray from the design standards</b> that
                ensure <b>accessibility</b>. For instance, oftentimes the colors
                do not effectively contrast, products are grouped in confusing
                categories, it is difficult to filter/scroll through products,
                and button functions are not evident. Overall, Zara could benefit
                from redesigning several components of its website to <b>more closely
                reflect </b> the traditional <b>online shopping conceptual models.</b>

                <h3 class="process-description" id="text-semibold">
                    In order to determine how the design elements of Zara's 
                    website could best be altered to align with user intution 
                    and industry-wide design best practices, I conducted a brief
                    analysis of the design choices and elements of websites that, 
                    most importantly, aligned with Zara's company vision and 
                    image. Although, as determined earlier, Zara's attempt 
                    at creating a website with an "editorial" or "magazine" tone 
                    has dircetly contributed to its un-usability, this theme is 
                    ultimately a defining factor of Zara's company brand and values, 
                    and must be preserved.

                The Vogue website served as a key point of inspiration that I 
                frequently referenced throughout this project. Note that Vogue
                shares a simmilar color pallette and minimalist style with Zara. 
                In addition, Vogue itself is the leading magazine in the fashion 
                industry, further aligning its brand image with Zara's. However, 
                unlike Zara, by following universal design principles, Vogue 
                successfully eminates a clean, artistic, and professional image 
                without sacrificing usability and accessibility.

                A second website that served as a strong point of reference is the 
                Djerf Avenue website. Djerf Avenue and Zara have overlapping target 
                audiences, and are both popular companies in the online clothing 
                retail space. Similarily to the above Vogue comparison, the Djerf 
                Avenue website also has a clean, yet artistic appeal, with similar 
                color palettes and design elements (e.g. the navogation bar) to that 
                of Zara's.

                Note that this was simply a redesign project - the best 
                user experience is ultimately determined by, well, the user. 
                Therefore, it is difficult to pre-emptively measure the success
                of these design choices. Moving forward, Zara can consider 
                conducting research through surveys, A/B testing, and more, in
                order to statistically determine whether or not a change in design
                is effective.
